# Reporting Security Issues

The Quick Quiz team and community take security bugs in Quick Quiz seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/mcgarrah/legendary_quick_quiz/security/advisories/new) tab. This issue will only be accessible by Quick Quiz team members initially.

The Quick Quiz team will send a response indicating the next steps in handling your report. After the initial reply to your report, the security team will keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining that module. The Quick Quiz team has dependency checking Github Actions setup for Python Libraries and Github Actions workflows. We have Javascript CDN monitored on the [TODO.md](TODO.md) and roadmap for a future feature to manage risks in outdated libraries.
