## Hosted Application Stopped; How do I start it?

If this application shows a screen that the application is not running, just press the button to start it up and it should start in a minute or so. This is expected behavior for the free tier of [Ploomber](https://ploomber.io/). And thanks for the free hosting.

## No questions are loaded; How do I load them?

In the **Settings** page, there is a section with buttons to Import, Export and Clear the Questions. By not selecting a JSON file on that page, it will automatically, load the `initial_questions.json` file from the webroot directory.

## Can I use HTML in the Question fields?

Not at this time. There is no provision for passing HTML or other presentation attributes thru for display.
