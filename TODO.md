- [ ] Add Markdown support for the Questions fields
  - [ ] [How To Use Python-Markdown with Flask and SQLite](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-python-markdown-with-flask-and-sqlite)
- [ ] Images or diagrams for questions missing

  - [ ] Add a BS5 navbar to templates for consistent user-interface

  - [ ] Turn README.md, TODO.md and FAQ.md into Flask route webpages for application documentation
  - [ ] [Rendering markdown from Flask](https://dev.to/mrprofessor/rendering-markdown-from-flask-1l41)
- [ ] Alternate Hosting
  - [ ] Pythonanywhere.com (reload every 3 months?!?)
    - [ ] Includes MySQL on free tier? Does it include options for CICD from Github repository?
    - [ ] Check out PythonAnywhere, they have a free tier allowing you to host a website with Flask/MySQL. (2 years ago)
    - [ ] Definitely has a free MySQL database for persistence
    - [ ] Definitely has a free webapp deployment for Python
    - [ ] Github Action for PAW via API and Token - https://github.com/umuttopalak/pythonanywhere-deploy-action

  - [ ] Render https://render.com/ (free tier applications go to sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity)
  - [ ] Ploomber is what I'm using right now
    - [ ] Has a Github Actions CICD option
    - [ ] Runs for 8 hours before stopping for inactivity - maybe ping self app to keep alive?
    - [ ] Two web apps limit on the free tier
    - [ ] No MySQL that I've found
  - [ ] ~~Fly.io used to have a free tier (now $5 a month + expense over $5)~~
  - [ ] MORE TO COME

High level features to add

- User authentication
- Persistent score tracking
- More detailed quiz results
- Admin interface for quiz creation
