# Things to do

Here is my list of todoes for the project.

## High level features to add

- User authentication and authorization
  - Persistent score tracking
  - Admin interface for quiz creation
- More detailed quiz results

## Todo tasks

- [ ] Look into Github Copilot for $10 a month or $100 a year
- [ ] Documentation
  - [ ] Add an overview of the Quick Quiz app for end-users in a webpage
  - [ ] Add inline the FAQ.md to the overview page
  - [ ] Turn README.md, TODO.md and FAQ.md into Flask routed webpages for application documentation
  - [ ] [Rendering markdown from Flask](https://dev.to/mrprofessor/rendering-markdown-from-flask-1l41)
  - [ ] Add a link that renders the FAQ.md as a HTML webpage or add inline to the Doc page
  - [ ] Add CHANGES.md and maybe ROADMAP.md file
- [ ] Make the "Correct: Yes/No" either red or green and bold in the submitQuiz() function in quiz.html
- [ ] Break the edit_question.html page into two parts so we can paginate the Existing Questions section
- [ ] Consider associating the Settings Duration and Number of Questions to each Quiz Category
- [ ] Add library dependency checkers to the Github repository
  - [x] Dependabot - Python pip requirements.txt
  - [x] Dependabot - Github Actions workflows
  - [ ] Javascript CDN (JS libraries)
    - [ ] [Cloudflare CDN JS](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/bootstrap)
    - [ ] [Automatically Update cdnjs Dependencies](https://www.mend.io/blog/automatically-update-cdnjs-dependencies/)

      - [ ] [CDNjs Datasource](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/datasource/cdnjs/)
      - [ ] [Automated Dependency Updates for CDN URL](https://docs.renovatebot.com/modules/manager/cdnurl/)

- [ ] Add Markdown support for the Questions fields
  - [ ] [How To Use Python-Markdown with Flask and SQLite](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-python-markdown-with-flask-and-sqlite)
  - [ ] [Flask-Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Flask-Markdown/) adds support for Markdown to your Flask application.
  - [ ] MathJAX extension would do the scientific things like "`H<sub>2</sub>O`" for water
- [ ] Images or diagrams for questions missing (probably not going to do this)
  - [ ] Markdown would improve this. A separate field that is optional.
  - [ ] I have not thought this thru... how to save the image binary?!?
- [ ] PyTest for unittests and webapp automated testing
  - [ ] Simple test of each route with even `curl` would be useful
  - [ ] Simple tests of routes with parameters
  - [ ] Steal from [Django CI](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/django.yml) for Flask CI Tests
  - [ ] [Python App CI](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/ci/python-app.yml) for Flake8 and Pytest

  - [x] Add a BS5 navbar to templates for consistent user-interface

  - [ ] Look at undoing the above `base.html` to `default.html` change
  - [ ] Look into bootstrap schemes for different colors
  - [ ] Dig into how to cache the JS/CSS files in root static directory
  - [ ] Python Module [Bootstrap-Flask](https://github.com/helloflask/bootstrap-flask) makes version updates to BS5 trackable by Dependabot

    - [ ] Cronjobs as a feature
  - [ ] Ploomber is what I'm using right now

    - [ ] Runs for 8 hours before stopping for inactivity - maybe ping self app to keep alive?
    - [ ] Two web apps limit on the free tier
    - [ ] No MySQL that I've found
    - [ ] app.py must be in the webroot or deployment fails... wow was that painful to learn
